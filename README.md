# 🍽️ DineSync

**DineSync** is a simple **online restaurant table booking system** built with **PHP** and **MySQL**.  
It provides both **Customer** and **Admin panel** functionality, making it easy for restaurants to manage bookings and for customers to reserve tables online.

## 📖 Overview

Restaurants can register on the platform to list their tables.  
Customers can sign up, search restaurants by **area** or **type of food**, view menus, and book tables.  
Each restaurant has its own **Admin panel** to manage table availability, bookings, and meals.  

Once a booking is accepted, the customer receives a **confirmation email**.  
Both customers and restaurants can update and manage their information at any time.
